clustal-match

This is a program created to quickly determine the n-length sequence of clustal alignment with most base-pair matches for use in PCR and LAMP primer design. 

The user can select a txt file containing a Clustal Omega alignment in Clustal w/ numbers format. In current form the program will work only for a four-sequence alignment. This issue will be addressed in future versions. 

Initial program made by SC 2017-09-22.
