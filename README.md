# clustal-match
This is a program created to quickly determine the n-length sequence of clustal alignment with most base-pair matches for use in PCR and LAMP primer design. 

The user can select a .txt file containing a Clustal Omega alignment in Clustal w/ numbers format. In current form the program will work only for a four-sequence alignment.

# Written by SC 2017-09-22.

# Future Directions:
- Modify so that sequence names are automatically taken from the .txt file (not static).
- Modify to work with any number of sequences.
- Modify to allow user to select which sequence to take final section from.
